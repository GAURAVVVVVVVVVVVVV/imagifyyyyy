Imagify is an AI-powered image generation service that lets users transform text prompts into unique, high-quality images. Users start with 5 free credits, enabling them to instantly generate up to five images at no cost. Once the free credits are exhausted, additional credits can be purchased to continue creating.

## Project Goals

- AI-Powered Creativity – Convert text prompts into high-quality images with ease.
- Free & Fair Access – Offer 5 free credits to new users, then a credit-based model for continued usage.
- Simple User Experience – Ensure an intuitive flow from prompt entry to image generation.
- Scalable & Extensible – Design a backend that can grow with demand and integrate new APIs/models.
- Empower Users – Help creators, developers, and hobbyists bring ideas to life visually.
